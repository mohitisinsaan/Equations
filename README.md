# Equations â€” RC 1 (Static)

Static site for Equations RC 1. Updated to ensure:
- Modal popup says Equations RC 1 and uses localStorage/sessionStorage so it appears on first visit and again only after 24 hours (revisits), but not on internal navigation.
- RC bubble and all references updated to RC 1.
- Boot animation shows 'Equations' and lasts ~6 seconds.

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

Deploy:
- Push to GitHub root.
- Import to Vercel as a static site. No build command needed. Output directory: root (`.`).
- Optional vercel.json can be added if you want rewrites.
